Obtain a snapshot of jsScheme from
http://www.tomelam.com/javascript-scheme/downloads/ .  Unarchive it
somewhere: either within your server's document root or, if you are
only going to load the HTML files locally in your browser, anywhere on
your computer.

There are three HTML files created to load jsScheme.js and
initScheme.js and then initialise jsScheme.js: scheme_dojo.html uses
Dojo, scheme_jquery.html uses jQuery, and scheme_no_jslib.html uses no
JavaScript library and provides fewer features (for example, no
loading or evaluating of Scheme files).  If you use a non-cross-domain
installation of Dojo or jQuery, you must download and install it and
modify an HTML file to use it.  jsScheme has been at least briefly
tested with Dojo 1.3.1 and jQuery 1.3.2 in Internet Explorer 6 and 8,
Firefox 3 (Mac and Windows), Safari 4 (Mac and Windows), Opera 9.26
(Windows), Rhino 1.7, Google Chrome 2.0.172.33 for Windows, and Google
Chrome 3.0.190.0 for the Mac (from Chrome's developer preview
channel). It runs in all these JavaScript browsers/environments.

To run jsScheme with Dojo in Rhino, follow the instructions at
http://www.dojotoolkit.org/forum/dojo-core-dojo-0-9/
dojo-core-support/run-dojo-rhino [URL broken across lines].  Basically
what that says is build a version of Dojo using the rhino profile.
After creating a rhino-profile build of Dojo, the following will work,
given that you have placed dojo and js.jar appropriately:

bash-3.2$ java -jar js.jar
Rhino 1.7 release 2 2009 03 22
js> load(['dojo/dojo/dojo.js'])
js> load(['jsScheme.js'])
js> var jslib_type="dojo"; 
js> load(['initScheme.js']);
js> init();
[jsScheme prints its banner]
js> callEval('(+ 3 4)').result;

Here are some debugging tips.  First of all, the use of Firebug, the
free-software Firefox extension, is very highly recommended.  Many web
developers swear by it.  When Firebug is not available, the Dojo
configuration property 'isDebug' can be set to true to enable Firebug
Lite, which is bundled with Dojo.  Visit http://dojotoolkit.org for
details.  Visit http://www.getfirebug.com for more information.
