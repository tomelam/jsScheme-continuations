<dt>27 June 2009, jsScheme revision 0.1-tae</dt>

<dd>

  <p> Changes by <a href="http://www.tomelam.com">Tom
Elam</a>. <em>Refactoring.</em> Created a modified version of the
program previously known as 'javascript-scheme' or 'jsScheme' and
named the new version 'jsScheme', with all features retained except
for the Scheme library functions (see below). The 'SA' signifies
'standalone', since the JavaScript can now be used independently of
the HTML to which is was previously bound. As a result of this
separation the JavaScript can now be embedded in any web page or can
used in a non-browser-based JavaScript interpreter like Rhino. Created
three versions of a demonstration HTML file: one to use jQuery, one to
use Dojo, and one, with a degraded user interface, to use
independently of any JavaScript library. These three files show
various ways Scheme applications running on jsScheme could be hosted
and debugged. For example, with all the checkboxes unchecked, there is
no visible output, hence no dependency upon the browser DOM for
output. There is no dependency upon the browser DOM for input because
the input is passed as a string to callEval (or, equivalently,
clickEval).

  <p> <em>Miscellaneous changes.</em> Exposed the internal trace
feature of jsScheme by attaching a checkbox with 'onchange' handler
to switch it on and off. (This is the same trace feature enabled by
the evaluation of the Scheme form '(trace #t)'.) Split the Scheme
library functions off into a separate, optional file in preparation
for their replacement, to allow Scheme programs to use the
interpreter/compiler without being GPL licensed themselves. Defined
all functions in the interpreter anonymously and assigned their values
to variables (like 'foo = function(...) {...}')  in preparation for
allowing the JavaScript to be required as a Dojo module, useful for
cross-domain loading, as from a content delivery network (CDN) like
Google's Ajax library CDN. The definition of the Continuation function
also had to be moved to make this work.

  <p> jsScheme can be downloaded from <a

target="_blank">here</a>. Send email to <a
 href="mailto:tomelam@gmail.com">Tom Elam</a> for the darcs patches to
Chris Double's (04 May 2006) version. More information will eventually
be available <a href="http://www.tomelam.com/javascript-scheme/"
target="_blank">here</a> (but not currently).
